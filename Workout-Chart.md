# 🏋️ Workout Progress Tracker

A structured log of my personal workout journey — including beginner, intermediate and advanced level routines.  
I maintain the main detailed chart in Google Docs, while this repository serves as a simplified & documented version.
This is a **7-day active routine within every 10-day block**, followed long-term for consistency rather than intensity.
